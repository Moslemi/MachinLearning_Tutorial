### Example of Machine Learning Questions ###


1) A Jupyter cell that contains code needs to have its type set to Code to be able to run it.

2) The series object series_obj has 5 items with the index labels 'row 1' through 'row 5', and the integer 
indexes 0 through 4 respectively. The command series_obj['row 3'] is equivalent to series_obj[2] .

3) In the dropna() DataFrame method, what will the argument axis=1 cause ... 
   ANSWERE: drop columns that contain missing values, instead of rows
    
4) You call the method duplicated() on an object and get a True value for row 8. This means that this row is 
   unique and has no duplicates.  
   ANSWERE: FALSE
   
5) What should you consider when appending a DataFrame to itself?
   Indexes will be duplicated and therefore inconsistent.
   
6) Pie charts represent data attribute values using a circle and slices that comprise it. A whole and entire set of categorical
 data is represented by the completely circle, and proportions of observations that fall into each category are represented by
 proportionate pie slices
 
 
 7) Pearson correlation assumption :::
 
    1_ Normally disturbuted
    2_ Linearly related
    3_ Continues numeric variable

8) Binomial variable:
   the variables which are just 1 or 0, so it is nit continues
   
9) Multinomial variable
   the variable which contain multi variables but it is not countinues

10) Spearmans rank assumption :::
    
    1_ your variables are ordinal (in other words numeric but able to be ranked like a categorical variable)
    2_ your variables are related non linearly
    3_ your data is non normally distributed
    
11) Chi Squre test :::

    1_ if P < 0.05 reject null hypothesis and consider the variables are correlated
    2_ if P > 0.05 reject null hypothesis and consider the variables are independent
    

 12) Why it is important to scale the data
     1_ to prevent different magnitute along the data cause misleading statics or errornous
     2_ to prepare data for machine learning
     
 12_1) Normalization
 putting all the observation on a relative scale between the value of 0 and 1
 $$ so it is like considering the value/ some of all the observation in variable $$
 
 
 12_2) Standardization
 rescaling data so it has a zero mean and unit variance
