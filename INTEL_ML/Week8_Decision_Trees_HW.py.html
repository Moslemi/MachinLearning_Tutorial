# # Decision Trees Exercises

# ## Introduction
# 
# We will be using the wine quality data set for these exercises. This data set contains various chemical properties of wine, such as acidity, sugar, pH, and alcohol. It also contains a quality metric (3-9, with highest being better) and a color (red or white). The name of the file is `Wine_Quality_Data.csv`.

# ### Prerequisites
# 
# Install pydotplus and seaborn in your own virtual environment
# 
# !pip install pydotplus
# 
# !pip install seaborn

# In[1]:


from __future__ import print_function
import os
data_path = ['data']


# ## Question 1
# 
# * Import the data and examine the features.
# * We will be using all of them to predict `color` (white or red), but the colors feature will need to be integer encoded.

# In[2]:


import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

filepath = os.sep.join(data_path + ['Wine_Quality_Data.csv'])
data = pd.read_csv(filepath, sep=',')


# In[3]:


data.head()


# In[4]:


data.dtypes


# Convert the color feature to an integer. This is a quick way to do it using Pandas.

# In[5]:


data['color'] = data.color.replace('white',0).replace('red',1).astype(np.int)


# ## Question 2
# 
# * Use `StratifiedShuffleSplit` to split data into train and test sets that are stratified by wine quality. If possible, preserve the indices of the split for question 5 below.
# * Check the percent composition of each quality level for both the train and test data sets.

# In[6]:


# All data columns except for color
feature_cols = [x for x in data.columns if x not in 'color']


# In[7]:


from sklearn.model_selection import StratifiedShuffleSplit

# Split the data into two parts with 1000 points in the test data
# This creates a generator
strat_shuff_split = StratifiedShuffleSplit(n_splits=1, test_size=1000, random_state=42)

# Get the index values from the generator
train_idx, test_idx = next(strat_shuff_split.split(data[feature_cols], data['color']))

# Create the data sets
X_train = data.loc[train_idx, feature_cols]
y_train = data.loc[train_idx, 'color']

X_test = data.loc[test_idx, feature_cols]
y_test = data.loc[test_idx, 'color']


# Now check the percent composition of each quality level in the train and test data sets. The data set is mostly white wine, as can be seen below.

X_train.head()


# ## Question 3
# 
# * Fit a decision tree classifier with no set limits on maximum depth, features, or leaves.
# * Determine how many nodes are present and what the depth of this (very large) tree is.
# * Using this tree, measure the prediction error in the train and test data sets. What do you think is going on here based on the differences in prediction error?

# The decision tree predicts a little better on the training data than the test data, which is consistent with (mild)  overfitting. Also notice the perfect recall score for the training data. In many instances, this prediction difference is even greater than that seen here.

# ## Question 4
# 
# * Using grid search with cross validation, find a decision tree that performs well on the test data set. Use a different variable name for this decision tree model than in question 3 so that both can be used in question 6.
# * Determine the number of nodes and the depth of this tree.
# * Measure the errors on the training and test sets as before and compare them to those from the tree in question 3.

# ## Question 5
# 
# * Re-split the data into `X` and `y` parts, this time with `residual_sugar` being the predicted (`y`) data. *Note:* if the indices were preserved from the `StratifiedShuffleSplit` output in question 2, they can be used again to split the data.
# * Using grid search with cross validation, find a decision tree **regression** model that performs well on the test data set.
# * Measure the errors on the training and test sets using mean squared error.
# * Make a plot of actual *vs* predicted residual sugar.

# ## Question 6 *(Optional)*
# 
# This question is optional as it requires an additional command line program (GraphViz) and Python library (PyDotPlus). GraphViz can be installed with a package manager on Linux and Mac. For PyDotPlus, either `pip` or `conda` (`conda install -c conda-forge pydotplus`) can be used to install the library.
# 
# Once these programs are installed:
# 
# * Create a visualization of the decision tree from question 3, where wine color was predicted and the number of features and/or splits are not limited.
# * Create a visualization of the decision tree from question 4, where wine color was predicted but a grid search was used to find the optimal depth and number of features.
# 
# The decision tree from question 5 will likely have too many nodes to visualize.
